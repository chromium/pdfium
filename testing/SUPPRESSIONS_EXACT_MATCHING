# List of tests to use fuzzy instead of exact matching, one per line.
# There are five space-separated columns per line
# Each column (except column 0) can contain a comma-separated list of values.
#
# Column 0: test file name
# Column 1: platform: *, win, mac, mac_arm, mac_x86, linux
# Column 2: v8 support: *, nov8, v8
# Column 3: xfa support: *, noxfa, xfa
# Column 4: rendering support: *, agg, gdi, skia
#
# All columns on a line must match, but filenames may be repeated on subsequent
# lines to suppress more cases.  Within each column, any one of the
# comma-separated values must match in order for the column to "match".
# The filenames and keywords are case-sensitive.
# One exception is the column 1, where "mac" is a shorthand that matches either
# "mac_arm" or "mac_x86".
#
# Try to keep the file alphabetized within each category of test.
